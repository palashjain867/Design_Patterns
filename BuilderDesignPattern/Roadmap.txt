Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to implement the Builder Design Pattern in C++:

Step-by-Step Guide
	1. Define the Product (Complex Object)
		○ Create a class (e.g., Car) that represents the complex object to be built.
		○ Include multiple attributes (e.g., engine type, number of seats, GPS system, etc.).
		○ Provide setter methods for setting individual attributes.
	2. Create the Builder Interface (Abstract Class)
		○ Define a Builder class with pure virtual methods for setting each attribute of the Car class.
		○ Include a virtual method getResult() that returns the fully constructed object.
	3. Implement Concrete Builders
		○ Create one or more concrete builder classes (e.g., SportsCarBuilder, SUVBuilder) that implement the Builder interface.
		○ Implement step-by-step construction methods that modify the internal Car object.
		○ Implement getResult() to return the fully built Car object.
	4. Create the Director Class (Optional but Recommended)
		○ Define a Director class that controls the construction process.
		○ The Director receives a Builder object and calls the builder’s methods in a specific sequence.
		○ This ensures consistent object creation and enforces construction rules.
	5. Implement Method Chaining (Fluent Interface, Optional)
		○ Modify builder methods to return *this (a reference to the builder itself).
		○ This allows chaining method calls like: 
builder.setEngine("V8").setSeats(2).setGPS(true);
		○ Improves readability and usability.
	6. Test the Implementation
		○ Create an instance of ConcreteBuilder.
		○ Pass it to the Director (if used) or call builder methods directly.
		○ Retrieve and verify the constructed object.
	7. Extend and Optimize
		○ Add more builders for different product variations.
		○ Ensure the pattern works well with smart pointers to manage memory efficiently.
		○ If needed, make the Director reusable by allowing dynamic builder swapping.

Example Use Cases
	• Car Manufacturing: A CarBuilder constructs cars with different configurations.
	• Meal Preparation: A MealBuilder assembles different types of meals based on user preferences.
	• Configuration Files: A ConfigBuilder builds complex configuration settings step by step.
