Hereâ€™s a step-by-step roadmap to implement the Strategy Design Pattern in C++:

Step-by-Step Guide
	1. Define the Strategy Interface (Abstract Class)
		â—‹ Create an abstract base class (e.g., Strategy) with a pure virtual function representing the algorithm (e.g., execute()).
		â—‹ This allows different algorithms to be implemented in derived classes.
	2. Implement Concrete Strategy Classes
		â—‹ Derive multiple concrete classes from Strategy, each implementing a different variation of the algorithm.
		â—‹ Example: CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, etc., if implementing a payment system.
	3. Create the Context Class
		â—‹ Define a Context class that uses a Strategy* (or smart pointer) as a member.
		â—‹ Provide a method setStrategy(Strategy*) to allow swapping strategies dynamically.
		â—‹ Implement a method (e.g., executeStrategy()) that calls the strategyâ€™s execute() function.
	4. Allow Dynamic Strategy Switching
		â—‹ Ensure the Context class can change strategies at runtime via setStrategy().
	5. Use Function Pointers or Lambdas (Alternative Approach)
		â—‹ Instead of defining concrete classes, you can use function pointers or std::function to pass different behaviors dynamically.
		â—‹ Example: 
std::function<void()> strategy = []() { std::cout << "Lambda Strategy\n"; };
	6. Test the Implementation
		â—‹ Create instances of different strategy classes.
		â—‹ Set different strategies in the Context class and verify behavior changes dynamically.
	7. Optimize and Extend
		â—‹ Add new strategies without modifying existing code.
		â—‹ Use std::unique_ptr instead of raw pointers for memory management.
		â—‹ Ensure thread safety if strategies are used in multi-threaded environments.

Example Use Cases
	â€¢ Payment Processing: Implement different payment methods (CreditCard, PayPal, Bitcoin).
	â€¢ Sorting Algorithms: Swap between QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort dynamically.
	â€¢ Compression Algorithms: Select different compression strategies like Zip, Rar, Gzip.
