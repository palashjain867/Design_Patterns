Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to implement the Singleton design pattern in C++:

Step-by-Step Guide
	1. Class Declaration
		○ Define the class (e.g., Singleton) with: 
			§ A private static pointer to hold the single instance of the class.
			§ A private constructor to prevent external instantiation.
	2. Static Accessor Method (getInstance())
		○ Declare and define a public static method, getInstance(), to provide access to the single instance of the class.
		○ Ensure this method initializes the instance on the first call and returns the same instance for subsequent calls.
	3. Disable Copy and Move Semantics
		○ Delete the copy constructor and copy assignment operator to prevent copying.
		○ Delete the move constructor and move assignment operator to prevent moving.
	4. Thread Safety
		○ Introduce a mutex to ensure the getInstance() method is thread-safe if the singleton is accessed in a multi-threaded environment.
		○ Use std::call_once or double-checked locking with a std::mutex for efficient thread safety.
	5. Resource Management
		○ Consider releasing the singleton instance's resources when the program ends (optional but useful in specific use cases). This can be achieved by using a std::unique_ptr with a custom deleter or a static destructor.
	6. Testing and Validation
		○ Verify that: 
			§ The class only allows a single instance.
			§ The instance remains consistent across multiple calls to getInstance().
			§ The implementation is thread-safe in multi-threaded tests.
	7. Example Use Cases
		○ Extend the Singleton class for a specific purpose, such as: 
			§ Logger class: Add methods to write logs.
			§ Configuration manager: Add methods to store and retrieve settings.
	8. Optimization and Best Practices
		○ Avoid early initialization if the singleton might not be used in all scenarios. Use lazy initialization in getInstance().
		○ Ensure that the implementation adheres to the single responsibility principle and does not become overly complex or a "God object."
