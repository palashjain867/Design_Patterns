Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to implement the Factory Design Pattern in C++:

Step-by-Step Guide
	1. Define an Abstract Base Class (Interface)
		○ Create an abstract class (e.g., Product) with at least one pure virtual function.
		○ This serves as the common interface for all derived classes.
	2. Implement Concrete Classes
		○ Derive multiple concrete classes (e.g., ConcreteProductA, ConcreteProductB) from the base class.
		○ Implement the virtual functions in each concrete class.
	3. Create the Factory Class
		○ Define a Factory class that contains a static method (createProduct()).
		○ This method takes an identifier (like an enum or std::string) and returns an instance of the appropriate subclass.
	4. Use Polymorphism for Object Creation
		○ Ensure the createProduct() method returns a pointer to the base class (Product*).
		○ Use new for dynamic allocation (or consider smart pointers like std::unique_ptr to manage memory safely).
	5. Test Factory Behavior
		○ Call the factory method with different parameters and verify that the correct objects are created.
		○ Use polymorphic behavior to interact with the objects via the base class pointer.
	6. Enhance with Smart Pointers (Optional)
		○ Instead of raw pointers, return std::unique_ptr<Product> or std::shared_ptr<Product> to ensure proper memory management.
	7. Optimize and Extend (Optional Enhancements)
		○ Implement a registry pattern to allow dynamic product registration.
		○ Support parameterized object creation (e.g., passing arguments to constructors).
		○ Ensure thread safety if the factory is used in a multi-threaded environment.

Example Use Cases
	• GUI Elements: Creating different types of buttons or checkboxes in a UI framework.
	• Database Connections: Factory method returns a connection object based on database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
